# MarchingCubesUnity
This project is for experimenting with the marching cubes algorithm in Unity. This algorithm will mainly be used to create terrain using various noise algorithms to generate caves, mountains, and irregular terrain.

The end goal is to have optimized modification of terrain at runtime, this includes a spherical brush and individual placement of voxels. Another goal of this project is to have the terrain deform with collisions "realistically" by accounting for the force and area of the collision.
